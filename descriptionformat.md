The description file is used by the program_listing.py script to create the JSON file used in the downloader. Here's an example:

```
emac
src/main.lua
Emac will be an advanced editor that will have plugins and more features than the base editor.
```

The first line is the name of a program. This is also the directory the program is in.

The second line is the file within the directory that the downloader should get.

The third line is a one-line description of the program.
